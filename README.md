# Task 1: COVID-19 Workforce Impact Analysis
Overview
This project looks at the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on India's job market, focusing on unemployment across different states. It explains the goals of the project and provides information on the dataset used.
Problem Statement
Unemployment in India increased significantly during the COVID-19 pandemic. The project aims to explore this impact by analyzing the unemployment rate, employment numbers, and labor participation rates across various states.
Dataset
The dataset gives detailed information about unemployment during the pandemic across Indian states, including key indicators like unemployment rate, employment figures, and labor participation rates.

# Task 2: 80 Cereals Project
The "80 Cereals" project uses a dataset with 77 types of cereal and 16 features. The goal is to predict cereal ratings and answer questions like:
What are the most popular cereals and brands?
Is there a link between sugar content and cereal ratings?
Is there a connection between fat content and calories?
What are the most important factors influencing cereal ratings?
Using a Random Forest Regressor, the project shows that sugars and calories are the key factors in predicting ratings. These features are crucial for feature selection when building a machine learning model.

# Task 3: Wine Quality Prediction
Objective
This project analyzes a dataset of red wine properties to find the factors that affect wine quality. The aim is to identify important features related to high-quality wine and offer recommendations for improvement. The analysis includes data exploration, visualization, and building predictive models.
By exploring the relationships between different wine properties and their quality ratings, the project uses the dataset for both classification and regression tasks.
